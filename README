Honestly, I have no idea what this is going to be yet.
Here is what I do know:
    Written in C
    Cross-platform (Linux + Windows 10) (Currently only runs on Linux)
    Client-server
    Moddable through Lua

Dependencies:
    SDL2
    Lua
    ENet
    GL
    GLEW

To build:
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

Currently implemented:
    Turing complete scripting (for configuration)
        Accepts command line arguments
Partially implemented:
    Lua sandboxes
    Model loader
    Model list
    Entity tree
    Networking
    Rendering

Needs to be rewritten:
    Everything
Needs to be deleted:
    str.h   string_t is slow, though better than it was.
