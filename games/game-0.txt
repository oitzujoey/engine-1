So I can't mess with time... but I can fake it.

Full disclosure: I watched STEINS;GATE, and it gave me some ideas on simulating time. The goal would be to create a game with a similar time travel mechanism.

Turn based
FPS -- Time travel powerup.

Spy vs. Spy could be interesting.

Use of time travel would have to be limited.

Turn based:
	Partial-multiplayer
		Players interact.
		Player 1 time travels.
		Player 1 does setup.
		Player 2 waits for Player 1 to finish.
		Players interact.
		Player 2 time travels.
		Player 2 does setup.
		Player 1 waits for Player 2 to finish.
		Players interact.
	Full multiplayer
		Not sure. Quake-like demos might be required.
		1.
			Omega 13 ­— Go back in time 13 seconds. This affects both players. This can only be used once by each player, though unlimited could be fun to try.
	Scripted
		Players write scripts for their avatars. Time travel can be initiated by the scripts. This allows actions in the past to be repeatable, but 
	Team

There seem to be two strategies: asymmetrical and asymmetrical
	Asymmetrical: One player has to wait for the other player to catch up to the current time.
	Symmetrical: Both players go back in time and the future is erased.
