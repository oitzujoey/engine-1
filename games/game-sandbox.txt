There's 1000 boxes. You can pick them up, move them, and set them down, including on top of other boxes. If you are holding a box then you can change the color by pressing a number key. The map is a big box. The server is always running. The state of the boxes is periodically backed up to a file in case the server crashes. The state of the boxes is loaded again on server startup.
