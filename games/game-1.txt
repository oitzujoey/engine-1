Features I will need:
* Lightmaps or direct lighting.
* Collision detection.

There are buildings. There are items. There are NPCs. There are long roads.

Buildings can be meshes.
Items can be small meshes.
NPCs are meshes too, but they might need pathfinding. Maybe use waypoints?
The long roads across large spaces of terrain might be a mesh. I could use a heightmap to generate the mesh ahead of time. I could also use procedural generation, but I'd rather not do that at runtime.
